What we know is that North Korea carried out 6 tests. We also know that the missiles were caried out at the Tonghae launching station. We also know that 3 of the tests succeeded and that 2 or 3 failed. We do not know exactly which ones were failures and which ones were successes. We also do not know exactly when these tests took place except that it was between April and September of 1984. You should read the information about these first tests not as events that certainly took place exactly as entered but as our best estimates as to what occured in a secret program within one of the most secret regimes in the world.
