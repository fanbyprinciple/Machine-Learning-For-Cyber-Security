### Generating text using Markov Chains

Markov chains are simple stochastic models in which a system can exist in a number of
states. To know the probability distribution of where the system will be next, it suffices to
know where it currently is.

### Natural language processing using a hashing vectorizer and if-idf with scikit learn

A token is a unit of text. For example, we may specify that our tokens are words, sentences,
or characters. A count vectorizer takes textual input and then outputs a vector consisting of
the counts of the textual tokens. A hashing vectorizer is a variation on the count vectorizer
that sets out to be faster and more scalable, at the cost of interpretability and hashing
collisions. Though it can be useful, just having the counts of the words appearing in a
document corpus can be misleading. The reason is that, often, unimportant words, such as
the and a (known as stop words) have a high frequency of occurrence, and hence little
informative content. For reasons such as this, we often give words different weights to
offset this. The main technique for doing so is tf-idf, which stands for Term-Frequency,
Inverse-Document-Frequency. The main idea is that we account for the number of times a
term occurs, but discount it by the number of documents it occurs in

# Chapter 2 Machine Learning Based Malware Detection

### Malware Static Analysis

It can be name or yara.

1. comparing and finding out the hash value

![](ch2_hashes.png)

2. Looking at YARA rules

![](ch2_yara.png)

3. Looking at section headers

![](ch2_section_headers.png)

4. Looking at feature sections

![](ch2_feature_sections.png)

### Malware dynamic analysis

Unlike static analysis, dynamic analysis is a malware analysis technique in which the expert
executes the sample, and then studies the sample's behavior as it is being run. The main
advantage of dynamic analysis over static is that it allows you to bypass obfuscation by
simply observing how a sample behaves, rather than trying to decipher the sample's
contents and behavior.

Malware can be analysed by setting up a cuckoo sandbox

### using machine learning to detect the file type

to curate a dataset we will scrape github
Shows the function of pyGithub

Be careful with the github password while doing this exercise!

File classifier made :

### Measuring similarity between two strings

To check whether two files are identical, we utilize standard cryptographic hash functions,
such as SHA256 and MD5. However, at times, we would like to also know to what extent
two files are similar. For that purpose, we utilize similarity hashing algorithms. The one we
will be demonstrating here is ssdeep

![](img/ch2_ssdeep.png)

Not very useful I feel, but only channging one letter the score comes down to 30

### Measuring similarity between two files

adding a null character at the end creates the following change

### Extracting N-grams

n the 1-grams are the, quick, brown, fox, jumped, over, the, lazy, and
dog. The 2-grams are the quick, quick brown, brown fox, and so on. The 3-grams are the quick
brown, quick brown fox, brown fox jumped, and so on

Just like the local statistics of the text
allowed us to build a Markov chain to perform statistical predictions and text generation
from a corpus, N-grams allow us to model the local statistical properties of our corpus.

### Selecting the best N-grams

![](img/ch2_partial_Ngrams.png)

First we had to download all the PE files

### Tackling class imbalance

### Handling type 1 and type 2 errors

In many situations in machine learning one type of error might be more important thatn other

![](img/ch2_thresholding.png)


Often in applying machine learning to cybersecurity, we are faced with highly imbalanced
datasets. For instance, it may be much easier to access a large collection of benign samples
than it is to collect malicious samples. Conversely, you may be working at an enterprise
that, for legal reasons, is prohibited from saving benign samples

# Chapter 3 Advanced Malware Detection

We would be working with following recipes

1. detecting obfuscated Javascript
2. Featurizing PDF files
3. Extracting Ngrams quickly by using hash-gram algorithm
4. Building a dynamic malware classifier
5. MalConv -  end to end deep learning for malicious PE detection
6. using packers
7. Assembling a pcked sample dataset
8. Building a classifier for packers
9. MalGAN

### Featurizing PDF files

is the PDFiD Python script designed by Didier Stevens
(https://blog.didierstevens.com/). Stevens selected a list of 20 features that are
commonly found in malicious files, including whether the PDF file contains JavaScript or
launches an automatic action. It is suspicious to find these features in a file, hence, the
appearance of these can be indicative of malicious behavior.

# Ch4 Machine Learning for Social Engineering

### Twitter spear phishing bot

In this recipe, we are going to use machine learning to build a Twitter spear phishing bot.
The bot will utilize artificial intelligence to mimic its targets' tweets, hence creating
interesting and enticing content for its own tweets. Also, the tweets will contain embedded
links, resulting in targets clicking these phishing links. Of course, we will not be utilizing
this bot for malicious purpose, and our links will be dummy links. The links themselves
will be obfuscated, so a target will not be able to tell what is really hidden behind them
until after they click.
Experimentally, it has been shown that this form of attack has a high percentage success
rate, and by simulating this form of attack, you can test and improve the security posture of
your client or organization

### Voice impersonation

Using the new technology of voice style transfer via neural networks, it is becoming easier
and easier to convincingly impersonate a target's voice. In this section, we show you how to
use deep learning to have a recording of a target saying whatever you want them to say, for
example, to have a target's voice used for social engineering purposes or, a more playful
example, using Obama's voice to sing Beyonc√© songs. We selected the architecture in
mazzzystar/randomCNN-voice-transfer that allows for fast results with high quality.
In particular, there is no need to pre-train the model on a large dataset of recorded audio

## Neural Network assisited fuzzing

![](img/ch5_nuezz.png)

## DeepExploit

DeepExploit is a penetration testing tool that elevates Metasploit to a whole new level by
leveraging AI. Its key features are as follows:

Deep penetration: If DeepExploit successfully exploits the target, it will
automatically execute the exploit to other internal servers as well. 

Learning: DeepExploit is a reinforcement learning system, akin to AlphaGo.

## Web server vulnerability scanner using machine learning (GyoiThon)

GyoiThon is an intelligence-gathering tool for web servers. It executes remote access to a
target web server and identifies products operated on the server, such as the Content
Management System (CMS), web server software, framework, and programming
language.

In addition, it can execute exploit modules for the identified products using
Metasploit.
