Arriving there was good off the plane quick straight onto a connecting bus to Brussels. Staff at the information stand were helpful & spoke English. The outbound journey wasn\\'t as pleasant security was over zealous (having to remove belt watch etc) and very unfriendly. Didn\\'t bother using the \\'canteen\\' in the cupboard (departure lounge 1) and there was a big crush fighting fellow passengers to get on the aircraft. The toilets in the lounge were filthy stinking & graffitid. Having said that for a flight that cost about the same as a pizza it\\'s worth putting up with and I\\'d use it again.\\nSmall airports are generally intimate friendly and welcoming. Not so with Charleroi. It is dirty seriously overcrowded at peak times and facilities are terrible. Ryanair does a good job of running a base on these facilities mind. Links to Brussels are good but that\\'s really thanks to Ryanair themselves. Food is terrible and waiting areas are not so conducive to extended stays (extended being anything more than 15 minutes)\\nWaited an hour in a corridor for baggage but ours was the only arrival in 3 hours. Waited 45 mins for the bus driver to let people on then he went off for a 30 min fag break which meant we missed the connecting train to Brussels we could have walked quicker to town centre. Return journey was even worse with one room which combined a corner shop style duty free school canteen snack bar non segregated smoking area which led to a single stinking toilet. It was a relief when the exits opened and we all made a charge for our non pre-allocated seats. Cheap but not cheerful next time I will pay the extra and fly direct from Manchester to Brussels Zaventem.\\n\"The previous comment is so off the mark it must have been written by one of the \"\"anti-Ryanair\"\" squad. Getting to / from the airport: an executive coach leaves Brussels south station (Gare du Midi) 2h. 30m. before each flight departure. As the average journey (± 60 km) takes one hour the bus arrives 90 minutes before the flight departs - in other words 60 minutes before check-in closes. The bus parks ± 50 metres from the departures door. For the return journey: buses leave the airport 20 mins or so after the flight arrivals back to Brussels Gare du Midi. At weekends I have done this journey in 40 minutes. Cost: €10.00 single payable to the driver. This includes an arbitrary €3.60 tax imposed by the Chairleroi Airport which is the subject of a legal action by Ryanair who charter the buses. Train / bus connections are not so good. I have written twice to TEC (Charleroi) asking why at weekends their \"\"connectional\"\" bus #68 from the airport arrives at Charleroi Railway station three minutes AFTER the hourly trains depart to Brussels. No intellgible answer was forthcoming - but they are Francophones and don\\'t ever take criticism - just offer a \"\"Gallic shrug\"\". A \"\"joined-up public transport service\"\" - NOT! Parking is plentiful and cheap with free shuttle buses to/'"},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"chars_list = sorted(list(set(reviews_text)))\nchar_to_index_dict = {\n    character: chars_list.index(character) for character in chars_list\n}\n                    ","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(char_to_index_dict)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"{'\\n': 0, ' ': 1, '!': 2, '\"': 3, '#': 4, '&': 5, \"'\": 6, '(': 7, ')': 8, '-': 9, '.': 10, '/': 11, '0': 12, '1': 13, '2': 14, '3': 15, '4': 16, '5': 17, '6': 18, '8': 19, '9': 20, ':': 21, 'A': 22, 'B': 23, 'C': 24, 'D': 25, 'E': 26, 'F': 27, 'G': 28, 'H': 29, 'I': 30, 'L': 31, 'M': 32, 'N': 33, 'O': 34, 'P': 35, 'R': 36, 'S': 37, 'T': 38, 'W': 39, 'Z': 40, 'a': 41, 'b': 42, 'c': 43, 'd': 44, 'e': 45, 'f': 46, 'g': 47, 'h': 48, 'i': 49, 'j': 50, 'k': 51, 'l': 52, 'm': 53, 'n': 54, 'o': 55, 'p': 56, 'q': 57, 'r': 58, 's': 59, 't': 60, 'u': 61, 'v': 62, 'w': 63, 'x': 64, 'y': 65, 'z': 66, '±': 67, '€': 68}\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Lets construct an RNN to learn and predict the sequence of characters","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import keras\nfrom keras import layers\n\nmax_length = 40\nrnn = keras.models.Sequential()\n\nrnn.add(layers.LSTM(1024, input_shape=(max_length, len(chars_list)), return_sequences=True))\nrnn.add((layers.LSTM(1024, input_shape=(max_length, len(chars_list)))))\nrnn.add(layers.Dense(len(chars_list), activation=\"softmax\"))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":14,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"optimizer = keras.optimizers.SGD(lr=0.01, decay=1e-6, nesterov=True)\nrnn.compile(loss=\"categorical_crossentropy\", optimizer=optimizer)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":16,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\n\ndef text_to_vector(input_txt, max_length):\n    sentences = []\n    next_characters = []\n    for i in range(0, len(input_txt) -
